- How CSS is Applied
    CSS is applied as CSS Rule/Ruleset
    selector: a part of html dom tree where we want to apply the style. 
   
    [selector] {
        property1:value1;
        property2:value2
    }
    properties of CSS: background-color, color, font-size, font-family, border, border-color, text-align etc.......
    Eg: body { -> selector
            background-color:yellow; //property and its value
            color:Red;
         }
- Different ways to apply CSS.
    1. Inline : it is applied to the html element directly. We use global attribute style:"property:value"
                It is always on highest priority.
    2. Internal : They are CSS Rules applied in the <style> </style> Tag. It is best practise to keep style 
                tag in the <head> tag
    3. External : This is the style applied to an external file with extension as .css.
                Then we apply the style sheet to the .html file with a <link> tag. It is best practise to link CSS
                in the <head> tag
            <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path of the CSS">
            Applying External style sheet is the best practise as if we want to apply to  more than 1 page and changes can reflect to all the pages by changing the external style sheet.

- Selectors:where we want to apply the style.
    - Simple Selectors : element{ property: value}
    - Universal selector : * { }
    - Attribute Selectors :
        id : #id
        class : .class
    - Combinator Selectors
        - Descendant combinator : A B	- Any element matching B that is a 
            descendant of an element matching A (that is, a child, or a child of
            a child, etc.). the combinator is one or more spaces or dual greater than 
            signs.
        - Child combinator : A > B -	Any element matching B that is a direct child of 
            an element matching A.  
        - Adjacent sibling combinator :	A + B - Any element matching B that is the next 
            sibling of an element matching A (that is, the next child of the same parent).
