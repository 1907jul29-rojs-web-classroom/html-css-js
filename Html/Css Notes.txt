CSS: 
- Cascading Style Sheets.
- CSS is used to make a web page look appealing to the user and hence it enhances 
    the User Experience.

- Where CSS is Applied 
CSS is Applied to DOM (Document Object Model) tree after the Html is loaded.

- How CSS is Applied
    CSS is applied as CSS Rule/Ruleset
    selector: a part of html dom tree where we want to apply the style. 
   
    [selector] {
        property1:value1;
        property2:value2
    }

    body {
        background-color:yellow;
        color:Red;
    }
- Different ways to apply CSS.
    1. Inline : it is applied to the html element directly. We use global attribute style:"property:value"
                It is always on highest priority.
    2. Internal : They are CSS Rules applied in the style Tag. It is best practise to keep style tag in the <head> tag
    3. External : This is the style applied to an external file with extension as .css.
    Then we apply the style sheet to the .html file with a <link> tag
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path of the CSS">
    Applying External style sheet is the best practise as if we want to apply to  more than 1 page and changes can reflect to all the pages by changing the external style sheet.

- Selectors:
    where we want to apply the style.
        - Simple Selectors : element{ property: value} , * { }
        - Attribute Selectors :
            id : #id
            class : .class
        - Combinator Selectors
            - Descendant combinator : A B	- Any element matching B that is a 
                descendant of an element matching A (that is, a child, or a child of
                a child, etc.). the combinator is one or more spaces or dual greater than 
                signs.
            - Child combinator : A > B -	Any element matching B that is a direct child of 
                an element matching A.  
            - Adjacent sibling combinator :	A + B - Any element matching B that is the next 
                sibling of an element matching A (that is, the next child of the same parent).
