CSS: 
- Cascading Style Sheets.
- CSS is used to make a web page look appealing to the user and hence it enhances 
    the User Experience.

- Where CSS is Applied 
CSS is Applied to DOM (Document Object Model) tree after the Html is loaded.

- How CSS is Applied
    CSS is applied as CSS Rule/Ruleset
    selector: a part of html dom tree where we want to apply the style. 
   
    [selector] {
        property1:value1;
        property2:value2
    }

    body {
        background-color:yellow;
        color:Red;
    }
- Different ways to apply CSS.
    1. Inline : it is applied to the html element directly. We use global attribute style:"property:value"
                It is always on highest priority.
    2. Internal : They are CSS Rules applied in the style Tag. It is best practise to kwwp style tag in the <head> tag
    3. External : This is the style applied to an external file with extension as .css.
    Then we apply the style sheet to the .html file with a <link> tag
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path of the CSS">

- Selectors:
    where we want to apply the style.
        - Simple Selectors : element{ property: value} , * { }
        - Attribute Selectors :
            id : #id
            class : .class
        - Combinator Selectors
