JavaScript:
- This is not Java
- It is a programming language.
- Majorly used for client-side interaction (interaction with webpages) and also for 
    some server side interation.
- It is loosely typed language, because variables can hold any type of the value.
- It is Dynamically typed. It means we can also assign some value to a variable while executing a program.
- JavaScript is interpreted. Means it runs code line by line.


Where do you run JavaScript programs?
- Any programming language requires environment/runtime (Program) to execute/run.
- For JavaScript we need Browser with JS Engine
- IE/Edge -> Chakra
- Mozilla- > Spider Monkey
- Chrome -> V8 Engine

History : 
- LiveScript- first name
- JavaScript - named it to make it as popular as Java
- ECMAScript
- ES5, ES6 -> ECMAScript 2015, ES9......

What JavaScript can do?
- Manipulate DOM (HTML): Eg create or remove html elements on fly
- Manipulate design : change CSS 
- Add behavior to web page : Animations, graphics etc....
- Call server programs with JavaScript
- interact with files
- You can store some values to client's machine (cache, cookies, localstorage, session storage)
- we can use Browser (Geolocation, Storage, DOM Api, Drag and Drop) or 3rd party APIs (Google Maps Api) with JS

How we can apply JavaScript to a web page?
- Inline : using event names . Eg: onclick, onchange, onblur....
- Internal : using <Script></Script> tag and writing JS in the tag
- External :using .js file for external JS and linking to the html using <Script src="path of the JS file"></Script>
    This also make JS resuable for any other webpages.
*It is always a best practise to keep JS at the end of the <body></body> tag* (for external and internal JS)

Events: Any action/user-defined action is called an event. Eg: mouse click, hover, page load etc....

Variables : it is a placeholder to store any value. This value can be changed and in JS variables can have 
value of any type, this is why we call JS as loosely typed. Eg: name ="Pushpinder Kaur", name=123

Constants : These are the values as well types which never change. Eg: pi = 3.14
